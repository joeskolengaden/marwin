/*

NOTE: Four Servos of the Robotic Arm are connected to 4 PWM Pins of Arduino 

and these 4 servos are named a, b, c and d. 

If you want to control servo a, then type "90a/", 

where "90" is the PWM value (range is 0 - 255), 

"a" means servo a and "/" is string parse delimiter. 

Some other examples: 100a/ or 120b/ or 40c/ or 25d/
