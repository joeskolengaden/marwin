# MARWIN
An Open Source Rapid Deployable DIY MARS Rover developed by Motify

## Primary Aim
To develop an opensource space rover by utilizing all posiible opensoure materals & resourses and also make the rover flexible  deployable for multiple purposes including research, resuce, military and defence purposes.

## Abstract

MARWIN is intended to be one of the first opensource DIY space rover projects which could be developed very easily. The rover is designed to be highly customizable with a modular design approach. MARWIN could open up the future for rapidly deployable rover solutions for exploration of other planets.

MARWIN intends to reduce the manufacturing cost and development time of rovers by implementing a quick and standardized design approach which could be customized very easily.

## Implementation Plan

* Rocker-Bogie system with RC.
* Scientific equipments ( sensor clusters).
* Power management system.
* Autonomous navigation.
* Video streaming and analysis.
* Testing and analysis.
* Modification and finalizing the design.
